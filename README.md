# Food-Dilivery-Time-Prediction

Food Dilivery Time Prediction :-

The primary objective of the "Food Delivery Time" dataset is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the time taken for food deliveries. By analyzing various factors such as delivery personnel characteristics, environmental conditions, and real-time variables like weather and traffic, the model aims to provide precise delivery time estimates. This can enhance customer satisfaction and optimize delivery operations. '''

#Problem Statement : 
'''
The task is to build a predictive model that estimates the total delivery time for food orders. The model should consider factors including:
Order details: type of food, restaurant, preparation time.
Market conditions: delivery demand, driver availability.
Traffic status: congestion, road closures.
By incorporating these variables, the model seeks to provide reliable delivery time predictions, thereby improving operational
efficiency and customer experience.
